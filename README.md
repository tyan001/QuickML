# QuickML

QuickML is a a Graphical User Interface (GUI) design to make Machine Learning models through the use of Tensorflow library. The current GUI supports easy handling of preprocessing data to gete it ready for the training phase of Machine Learning, then you are able to make models with some parameters restriction to not make crazy models.

Dependecies:
* Tensorflow == 2.3.1 <br>
* pyqt5 == 5.15.1 <br>
* numpy == 1.19.4 <br>
